#### Except those with speed labels, they can all achieve a speed more than 73 mph.

### Deep (large) networks:
I trained these networks with high gamma values. That is, during the training process, these networks will consider the deepest future. However, they often take a long time to train.

### Two layers networks:
A neural network with two layers whose activation functions are non-linear can approximate arbitrary functions. I tried to train the smallest network without losing performance.
